      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello there,
        I'm a beginner developer with a passion for web technologies such as Ruby, AngularJs among many other current popular web technologies. I started coding in 2013 though with C++ where I learnt the basics of variables, datatypes and flow control. I moved on to Java to learn Object Oriented Programming which was not a very wise idea either.
        I then learnt about HTML and CSS late in 2014 where I found great interest and simplicity of use of web languages. I learnt PHP as my first server side language for a school project which wasn't a good idea (idk why I kept making the wrong choices) till I learnt about Ruby and it's rails framework in 2016. Today I have enrolled intoCraft Academy  <a href="https://craftacademy.se/english/">Craft Academy </a>
        where I hope to learn the full stack using ruby as a server side language and Ionic to build multiplatform mobile apps. I will keep posting more of my journey and experiences as I grow through the Craft Academy experience.
